                Hi, I'm Abelaash
                <br>
                I'm a Computer Programmer graduate at Humber College and finished working as a <b><i>Software Developer</i></b> internship at <b>Central Etobicoke Youth Agency (CEYA INC)</b>. 
                I love to develop, create and make web and mobile applications. I am passionate in frontend and backend development and including mobile related platforms and cloud-based platforms. <br>I like to take part in extracurricular activities such as working on projects with other developers and take part in clubs to learn about new technologies.
                Currently, I'm going to enroll to <b>Humber</b> and start my advanced diploma for the <b> Computer Programming & <br> Analysis</b> program and on a outlook for internship jobs like <b>Web Development, Full Stack Development, Mobile Development, and Data Science</b><br> between Winter 2023, where I can develop, learn and provide value throughout my skills.
                <br>Thank you for your time in visiting my portfolio website!
